""" After writing aphora.py and converting to Notion, I noticed that my table
of some 300+ quotes was very slow in the Electron (ðŸ¤¢)-based Notion client. By
this time, I had begun to become enamoured with Emacs and org-mode. So this is
a tiny script that converts a CSV file (downloaded from the Notion database) to
an org-mode file.

I used pandas to wrangle the CSV, because I wanted more practice with pandas.
To make it more efficient, I could just import the CSV- and dataframe-related
modules. """
