"When an apple ripens and falls — what makes it fall? Is it that it is attracted to the ground, is it that its stem withers, is it that the sun has dried it up, that it has grown heavier, that the wind shakes it, that the boy standing underneath wants to eat it? … [Great men’s] every action, which seems to them willed by themselves, in the historical sense is not willed, but happens in connection with the whole course of history and has been destined from before all ages.",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace,"Feb 22, 2020 4:56 PM"

"But none of the feelings which the joys or misfortunes of a “real” person arouse in us can be awakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes, and the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding that, as the image was the one essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that the simplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple, of “real” people would be a decided improvement.",Marcel Proust,Swann's Way,"Feb 22, 2020 4:57 PM"
"We try to discover in things, which become precious to us on that account, the reflection of what our soul has projected onto them; we are disillusioned when we find that they are in reality devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilize all our spiritual forces in a glittering array in order to bring our influence to near on other human beings, who, we very well know, are situated outside ourselves where we can never reach them.",Marcel Proust,Swann's Way,"Feb 22, 2020 4:57 PM"

"Helen Burns: ""It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you — and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil... it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to be required to bear.""
Jane Eyre: ""A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard... I must dislike those who, whatever I do to please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly.""
Helen Burns: ""It is not violence that best overcomes hate — nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury... Life to me seems too short to be spent in nursing animosity, or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will remain, — the impalpable principle of life and thought... I hold another creed... for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest... with this creed revenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end.""",Charlotte Brontë,Jane Eyre,"Feb 22, 2020 4:57 PM"

Helen: ""Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too impulsive, too vehement...

"It is vain to say human beings are to be satisfied with tranquility: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: a woman feels just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidery bags.

Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, ignis-fatuus-like, into miry wilds whence there is no extrication.",Charlotte Brontë,Jane Eyre,"Feb 22, 2020 4:57 PM"

A true realist, if he is not a believer, will always find in himself the strength and ability to not believe in miracles as well, and if a miracle stands before him as an irrefutable fact, he will sooner doubt his own eyes than admit the fact. And if he does admit it, he will admit it as a fact of nature, previously unknown to him. In the realist, faith is not born from miracles, but miracles from faith. Once the realist comes to faith, then precisely because of his realism, he must also allow for miracles... he believed first and foremost because he wished to believe, and may be already fully believed in his secret heart even as he was saying: ""I will not believe until I see.""",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace,"Feb 22, 2020 4:57 PM"

"It's of some interest that the lively arts of the millennial USA treat anhedonia and internal emptiness as hip and cool. It's maybe the vestiges of the Romantic glorification of Weltschmerz, which means world-weariness or hip ennui. Maybe it's the fact that most of the arts here are produced by world-weary and sophisticated older people and then consumed by younger people who not only consume art but study it for clues on how to be cool, hip — and keep in mind that, for kids and younger people, to be hip and cool is the same as to be admired and accepted and included and so Unalone. Forget so-called peer-pressure. It's more like peer-hunger. No? We enter a spiritual puberty where we snap to the fact that the great transcendent horror is loneliness, excluded encagement in the self. Once we've hit this age, we will now give or take anything, wear any mask, to fit, be part-of, not be Alone, we young. The US arts are our guide to inclusion. A how-to. We are shown how to fashion masks of ennui and jaded irony at a young age where the face is fictile enough to assume the shape of whatever it wears. And then it's stuck there, the weary cynicism that saves us from gooey sentiment and unsophisticated naïveté. Sentiment equals naïveté on this continent (at least since the Reconfiguration). One of the things sophisticated viewers have always liked about J. O. Incandenza's The American Century as Seen Through a Brick is its unsubtle thesis that naïveté is the last true terrible sin in the theology of millennial America. And since sin is the sort of thing that can be talked about only figuratively, it's natural that Himself's dark little cartridge was mostly about a myth, viz. That queerly persistent US myth that cynicism and naïveté are mutually exclusive. Hal, who's empty but not dumb, theorizes privately that was passes for hip cynical transcendence of sentiment is really some kind of fear of being really human, since to be really human (at least as he conceptualizes it) is probably to be unavoidably sentimental and naïve and goo-prone and generally pathetic, is to be in some basic interior way forever infantile, some sort of not-quite-right-looking infant dragging itself anaclitically around the map, with big wet eyes and froggy-soft skin, huge skull, gooey drool. One of the really American things about Hal, probably, is the way he despises what it is he's really lonely for: this hideous internal self, incontinent of sentiment and need, that pules and writhes just under the hip empty mask, anhedonia.

For instance, after Orin had pretty clearly killed her beloved dog S. Johnson in a truly awful if accidental way, and then had tried to evade responsibility for it with a lie that a parent far less intelligent than Avril could have seen right htrough, Mrs. Inc's response was not only not conventionally abusive, but seemed almost too unconditionally loving and compassionate and selfless to possibly be true.""",David Foster Wallace,Infinite Jest,"Feb 22, 2020 4:59 PM"
